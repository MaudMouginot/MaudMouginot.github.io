The primary objective of RES501 is to provide students with a solid foundation in quantitative research methods and statistical analysis techniques. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand, apply, and critically evaluate statistical methodologies commonly used in social science research. Additionally, the course aims to foster a deep appreciation for the role of data analysis in informing evidence-based decision-making and hypothesis testing.

The course covers topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, linear model selection, resampling techniques, fitting non-linear functions, tree-based methods, principal components analysis (PCA), clustering, and reproducible research. Practical application is emphasized through hands-on lab sessions using RStudio for data analysis and manipulation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with essential tools and skills to conduct data-driven research and effectively analyze social science data.
