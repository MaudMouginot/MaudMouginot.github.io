Introductory anthropology course grounded in biological and evolutionary anthropology.


Instructor for ANTH 201 *Introduction to Anthropology*. I independently designed and taught a novel introductory undergraduate anthropology course which explores human and primate biology from an evolutionary perspective with the aim of critically reviewing the biological basis of human development and behavior. This course introduces students to the most important concepts and subfields in human evolutionary theory including natural and sexual selection, genetic drift and flow, population genetics, primate evolution, paleoanthropology, behavioral ecology, socio-biology, and human variation and adaptation. Trough discussion and critical analysis, these topics are used to enrich our understanding of how our daily lives are influenced by our own unique evolutionary history.
