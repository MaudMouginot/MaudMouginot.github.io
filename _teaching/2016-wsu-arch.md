Introductory archaeology course of great archaeological	discoveries and	the work of archaeologists on our sense of the past.

Instructor for ANTH 130 *Great Discoveries in Archaeology*. I independently designed and taught a novel introductory anthropology course on archaeology. The course covered basic concepts in the field, prehistory and human origins, and major archeological periods including the Upper Paleolithic. We also discussed major archaeological cultures and features, such as megaliths and complex societies, with a special focus on social structural underpinnings and implications for human cultural evolution.
