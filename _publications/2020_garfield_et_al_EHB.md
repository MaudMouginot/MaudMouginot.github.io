permalink: /publication/2020_garfield_et_al_EHB
excerpt: <blockquote>Leaders across cultures rely on a range of individual competencies, including cognitive, supernatural, material, social, and physical endowments, to organize group members, implement strategic actions, provide prosocial services to the group, and impose costs, all while conforming to cultural norms. Currently, no single theoretical perspective has yet captured the ethnographic reality of human leadership.</blockquote>

This exploratory study identified the qualities and functions of leaders, as well as the costs and benefits of leadership for leaders and followers, from a representative sample of nonindustrial societies. It was published in a special issue of [Evolution and Human Behavior, "Beyond WEIRD"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/evolution-and-human-behavior/vol/41/issue/5), commemorating and discussing the 10th anniversary of Henrich et al.'s paper, *The weirdest people in the world?*
