excerpt: <blockquote>Our results suggest Hamar maintain cooperative and peaceful communities primarily through social structures, high within-clan cohesion, and gendered divisions of social and economic life, more so than through direct third-party mediation. Third parties, however, play a crucial role, especially in mediating social conflicts, and their involvement is often an effective and necessary solution for resolving severe interpersonal conflicts.</blockquote>
