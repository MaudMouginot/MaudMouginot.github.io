title: "Differences in expression of male aggression between wild bonobos and chimpanzees."

excerpt: 'Researchers investigating the evolution of human aggression look to our closest living relatives, bonobos
(Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), as valuable sources of comparative data. Males in
the two species exhibit contrasting patterns: male chimpanzees sexually coerce females and sometimes
kill conspecifics, whereas male bonobos exhibit less sexual coercion and no reported killing.
Among the various attempts to explain these species differences, the self-domestication hypothesis proposes
negative fitness consequences of male aggression in bonobos. Nonetheless, the extent to which
these species differ in overall rates of aggression remains unclear due to insufficiently comparable observation
methods. We used 14 community-years of focal follow data—the gold standard for observational
studies—to compare rates of male aggression in 3 bonobo communities at the Kokolopori Bonobo
Reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo, and 2 chimpanzee communities at Gombe National Park, Tanzania.
As expected, given that females commonly outrank males, we found that bonobos exhibited lower rates of
male-female aggression and higher rates of female-male aggression than chimpanzees. Surprisingly, we
found higher rates of male-male aggression among bonobos than chimpanzees even when limiting analyses
to contact aggression. In both species, more aggressive males obtained higher mating success. Although our
findings indicate that the frequency of male-male aggression does not parallel species difference in its intensity,
they support the view that contrary to male chimpanzees, whose reproductive success depends on
strong coalitions, male bonobos have more individualistic reproductive strategies.'
