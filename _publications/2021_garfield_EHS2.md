title: "The content and structure of reputation domains across human societies: a view from the evolutionary social sciences"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021_garfield_EHS2
excerpt: <blockquote>We hypothesize reputations for cultural group unity will be a context-independent universal, likely to manifest in all human societies, whereas reputations for social and material success, neural capital, and dominance are more likely to be context-dependent universals, promoted or suppressed by socio-ecological or cultural evolutionary processes.</blockquote>
