excerpt: <blockquote>The high colinearity of the diverse traits measured here suggests that each of the domains of leadership traits that we investigated — cognition, sociality, productivity, reproduction, and dominance — are potentially important in understanding variation between leaders and non‐leaders. To systematically overlook any of these domains may be a severe methodological limitation and this strong positive covariation of most leadership traits warrants further investigation.</blockquote>

This empirical field study provides rare quantitative data on elected leadership among a relatively egalitarian society, including on female and male leaders. Results are interpreted in reference to influential evolutionary theoretical models. This publication is part of a special issue of [The Leadership Quarterly on the Evolution and Biology of Leadership](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-leadership-quarterly/vol/31/issue/2).
