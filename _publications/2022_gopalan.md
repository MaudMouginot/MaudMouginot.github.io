title: "Hunter-gatherer genomes reveal diverse demographic trajectories during the rise of farming in Eastern Africa"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022_gopalan
excerpt: <blockquote>By analyzing eleven Eastern African populations, we find evidence for divergent demographic trajectories among hunter-gatherer-descendant groups. Our results illustrate that although foragers respond to encroaching agriculture and pastoralism with multiple strategies, including cultural adoption of agropastoralism, gene flow, and economic specialization, they often face population decline.</blockquote>
