I am an interdisciplinary evolutionnary anthropologist and currently a postdoctoral associates at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Luke Glowacki. I am a member of the [The Omo Valley Research Project](http://www.omovalleyresearchproject.org) and recently started establishing three new field sites in the Omo Valley Region with Dr. Zachary Garfield and Dr. Luke Glowacki.

I was previously a research fellow at [the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Biological Anthropology at the University of Minnesota. I validated a Master's degree along the way in this same university and also obtained a Master's degree in Human Pathology with a speciality in Forensic Anthropology at Aix-Marseille University (France). Finally, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Anthropology at the University of Montr√©al (Canada). 

I am also a french science-fiction author under the pseudonym Alexis Demey. I published two novels which aim to introduce anthropology to a broad audience using science-fiction and will publish more in the future.
