*_**ODK-X work**_
- Co-develop the AnthroCollect application with ODK-X Survey for the Omo Valley Project – This app is designed to link individuals and households as well as to support phonetic research of individual’s name. It directly creates a relational database and assign a unique ID for each household and individual. It also enables the creation of customized forms for conducting interviews at the household or individual levels.
- Design and develop interview forms using ODK-X survey for various data collection contexts, including household, individual census, and social network surveys.
